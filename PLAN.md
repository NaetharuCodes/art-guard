# What is Art Guard?

This is a platform for artists. We provide the following:

- **Portfolio hosting**: We provide a secure place to host their portfolio
- **Commission Process**: Artists often struggle with how to handle commissions. We provide them with a structured process.
- **IP Protections**: We function as a central registry for their copyright and provide both active and passive IP protections.

## Portfolio Hosting

We provide a central place to host a curated portfolio. This is in a standard format, and will host between 5 and 10 pieces of work, along with nodes and details
from the artist to clearly demonstrate their offering. This is NOT a place to host everything that they have ever done. Rather, it is one place for their demo work
that they feel best represents them to a prospective client.

## Commission Process

Many artists struggle with commissions. So we provide a structured process that helps them secure work and achieve successful outcomes.

- Link to their portfolio.
- Clear pricing with examples.
- Clear demos of references needed for work.
- Clear process -> Request -> Provide Info -> Create Thumbnails -> Revise Thumbnails -> Create Draft -> Revise Draft -> Complete
- An Escrow service to protect both artist and buyer.

We also provide some technical safeguards, checking submitted work is original and free from AI content. This protects the buyer, and the real artists who are
being undercut by people exploiting AI technology.

## IP Protections

We function as a central repository for copyright registration. While copyright is automatic, proving that you own that copyright can be challenging. Artists are able to
upload their works and the date and content is marked. At which point they have a clear place to point to in order to show that they were the original creator of the work
in question.

We provide active and passive defences against AI ingestion:

- We obscure art we host to prevent AI scraping.
- We use detection tools to identify bot-requests and provide substitution images to poison bot-scraping.
- We use propriatory tooling to poison images so that in the event of AI scraping they cause overall negative impacts to the datasets.
- We actively make takedown and removal requests to the major AI companies on behalf of all artists.
